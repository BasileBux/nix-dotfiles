# Quickshell config

This is my personal Quickshell configuration. It is integrated with my NixOS configuration
and home-manager. However, it can be used independently of nix or any other package manager.

## Credits

This configuration was made from scratch but highliy inspired by the [celestia-shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell)
configuration. I used the latter as a reference to learn quickshell and some more
obscure ways to use it.

A lot of the icons used in this configuration come from https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/framework7-line-icons/

### Wallpapers

This repo also contains some wallpapers I took from various sources which I will
credit here (I am missing some, if you know the source of a wallpaper, please let
